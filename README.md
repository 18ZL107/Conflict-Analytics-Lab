## Description
The OpenJustice AI, developed by the Conflict Analytics Lab, is a specialized GPT designed for the legal field. Its primary aim is to assist professional groups in effectively addressing their legal challenges. As this project marks the early stages of the platform's deployment, understanding current user engagement and platform performance is crucial. The insights gained will enable targeted improvements, enhancing the platform's capability to track, analyze, and respond to user interactions effectively. This, in turn, will improve the platform's usability, ensuring it meets the needs of the community and maximizes its societal benefits.

This repository contains all the project files organized into four main folders:
- **Dashboards**: Contains user guides for different pages of the dashboard and the link to access the dashboard, which is editable (client only).
- **Research Files**: Contains documented raw research work done for client update meetings.
- **Weekly Updates**: Summarized slide decks for weekly meetings with client feedback in red text.
- **Code Files**: Includes proof of concept code demos for evaluating the current GPT performance, with actual data blurred due to the signed NDA.
