There are two user guides for this dashboard: one for Google Analytics pages and another for the conversation evaluation results page, as they connect to different data sources. Additionally, there is a home page that provides a more detailed explanation of how the dashboard works. Editing permissions have been granted to clients (no guide for this page as it is just a introduction), so the link provided is for viewing the interactive dashboard only.
